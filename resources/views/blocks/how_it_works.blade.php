                            Go to the application, choose any car on the map. The letters "A" and "M" on the machines mean automatic transmission and mechanics, respectively. Click on the car and see detailed information. Choose one of the tariffs: minute, hour or daily.
                        </p><p>
                            All cars are insured with a deductible (an amount that is not covered by insurance), but before each rental you can purchase additional insurance, which will significantly reduce your liability in the event of a traffic accident. Usually this function is chosen so as not to be nervous while driving because of the possibility of damaging the car or limiting possible costs. The cost of additional insurance depends on the tariff and brand of car and will be displayed on the information card.
                        </p><p>
                            Choose a rate - book a car. The booked car will become inaccessible to other users, at this time you can reach the car. You have 3 free bookings of 20 minutes within 24 hours. Then billing will begin - 1 UAH / min.
                        </p><p>
                            You can get directions to the car, the application will show the distance and approximate time to the car. To do this, click on the icon with a little man.
                        </p><p>
                            For the feature to work, you must grant the app access to your location. Do this during registration or in the phone settings, go to the Getmancar application and provide the necessary access.
                        </p><p>
                            When booking, the amount of the deposit is blocked on your account, which depends on the class of car and the tariff and amounts to 300-3000 UAH, but sometimes the deposit can be increased.
                        </p><p>
                            The deposit is blocked only once a day and is returned the next day after the end of the car rental, usually already at 01:15.
                        </p><p>
                            Before renting, make sure that there are enough funds on the account to block the deposit and pay the tariff.
